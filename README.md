Hello!, 

This is my rough idea....

With the increasing popularity of games, the management and analysis of past in-game events becomes increasingly more significant as the player base and complexities of games evolve. A common denominator within most games is the absence of in-game event tracking, players have a way to execute events but they do not have a way to review each past event committed. Having an in-game event tracker can help players review any changes to their characters and track the progressive development of characters on an ongoing basis - this can help prevents users from spending far too much time on the game if they have hit a goal (E.g collected enough items for today) and for users that are forgetful, they're able to account for what they previously did.
